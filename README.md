# Jiequan, Demon of The Abyss
## Voidbringer Jiequan: Veteran Challenge
Major overhaul of Voidbringer Jiequan featuring increased difficulty, rebalancing and code optimization, intended for veterans who have previously cleared Voidbringer Jiequan and/or Promised Eigong and/or other Eigong mod combinations. It is much more aggressively overtuned and will not be nerfed post-release like Voidbringer Jiequan ended up.

Disclaimer: I have yet to implement some quality of life patches, such as a faster phase change animation or better visuals. It takes a lot of energy to put up with RCG's bullshit code and naming and is always a genuinely frustrating at worst, or at best an extrasensory experience to work with.

**The verbose, fully documented changelog will remain undisclosed until Hall of Fame completion. You are to complete this challenge blind and with no help from me. I have defeated it hitless for verification, though I'm obviously not counting my run for any Hall of Fame spot and I believe that some of the higher difficulty extras will not be completed for a fairly long time.**

Message me on discord, @marcerysf either directly or by pinging me in one of the Nine Sols servers for Hall of Fame applications. The format is as follows: A preferably public, but can be unlisted YouTube or Bilibili video link and a username that you want displayed on the hall. The Hall of Fame will be displayed here on the mod page. There'll be a section for the first 10 Public clears and a first 10 Hitless completions, not mutually exclusive with eachother as well as a few extras.

The Hall of Fame will be updated periodically, though not at a regular pace. I'm gonna try to not keep it on the backburner like I did with Voidbringer Jiequan.
Updates will be shared in the Nine Sols Modding discord thread associated to the mod and in the Nine Sols Speedrunning discord or when personally asked.

The Hall of Fame will feature a single spot for every Extra challenge completion, namely the following completions:
- Damageless
- Pacifist
- Jadeless
- Any combination of the 2
- All 3 at once
*All of the extras are mutually exclusive and you may not qualify for more than one with one completion.*

**Good luck!**

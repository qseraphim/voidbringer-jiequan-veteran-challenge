# Jiequan, the Bringer of Void

A vastly more difficult rework of Jiequan's fight. Includes a third phase, custom attack weights, new fakeout moves, new conditions, aggressive speed-ups that require the player to stay locked in and a unique challenge mode.

With a heavy hint of Promised Eigong design philosophy but taken a few notches further with difficulty and meta jade setup variety, Void Jiequan shall be my *real* debut Nine Sols mod. Lvl 0 beatability has not been kept in mind when designing the boss.

## Current changes and new additions (v1.1.0)

### Universal changes
- Damage received from most of Jiequan's attacks is increased by 50%
- Crimson Smash is now an instant kill on hit (though Revival Jade can prevent that)
- Crimson Smash now has a 30% chance to be interrupted and followed up with an instant Horizontal Thrust instead.
- Similarly, with the same 30% chance, Daggers can also fake out, into one of two equally likely attacks: Teleport, Crimson Thrust
- Crimson Thrust can now, with a 30% chance, fake out into Teleport (This, with the above change, can result in consecutive fakeouts)
- Jiequan can no longer be staggered by most means. This causes a few interactions to now happen:
  - Breaking the shield no longer stuns Jiequan and no longer interrupts his healing
  - Cloud Piercer and 5 Qi Full Control detonations no longer briefly stun him
- The following attacks have been sped up as follows:
  - Double Slash is 70% faster
  - Daggers is 70% faster (Projectile speed unchanged)
  - Diagonal Thrust is 80% faster
  - Plunge is 70% faster
  - Crimson Smash is 70% faster
  - Stab is 70% faster
  - Grenades is 70% faster (Again, projectile speed unchanged)
  - Shield is 100% faster
  - Teleport is 200% faster
  - Horizontal Thrust is 80% faster
  - Crimson Thrust is 70% faster
- A brand new third phase has been added with custom attack weights

### Phase 1 changes
- Health increased to 7500 (Previously: 5400)
- Teleport can now be performed
- Double Slash can be now followed up with: Crimson Thrust, Crimson Smash, Teleport and itself
- Stab can now be followed up with: Double Slash, Teleport and Plunge
- Plunge will always be followed up by this sequence: Diagonal Thrust, Horizontal Thrust and Grenades
- Grenades can now be followed up with: Daggers, Shield and itself
- Daggers can now be followed up with: Stab, Grenades and itself
- Teleport can now be followed up with: Stab, Double Slash and itself
- Crimson Thrust can now be followed up with: Plunge and Daggers
- Crimson Smash and Shield act as "finisher" attacks. Jiequan will follow up with a default "starter" attack after performing either one: Stab, Double Slash, Diagonal Thrust, (not extensively tested) Plunge
  - Only the starter attacks change between phases. Crimson Smash and Shield are always considered finisher attacks, and the stagger state also counts as one.

### Phase 2 changes
- Health increased to 8000 (Previously: 4320)
- Same attack followups and starter attacks as vanilla Jiequan, except for the new fakeout attacks mentioned in the universal changes section

### Phase 3 features
- Boss has 8500 health
- Uses phase 2's starter attack list
- Shield can now be performed again
- Double Slash can now be followed up with: Crimson Thrust, Diagonal Thrust, Horizontal Thrust, Plunge, Teleport and itself
- Stab can now be followed up with: Horizontal Thrust and Crimson Smash
- Plunge can now be followed up with: Stab, Shield and Teleport
- Teleport can now be followed up with: Grenades, Double Slash, Crimson Thrust, Crimson Smash and itself
- Diagonal Thrust is always followed up with Crimson Smash
- Horizontal Thrust can now be followed up with: Shield, Daggers, Crimson Smash and itself
- Grenades is always followed up with Daggers
- Daggers can now be followed up with: Daggers and Double Slash
